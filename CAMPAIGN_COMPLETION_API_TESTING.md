# üöÄ Campaign Auto-Completion Manual Trigger API Testing Guide

## üìã Overview

All endpoints require authentication. You need:
- Bearer token in Authorization header
- Admin role for global triggers
- Brand/Admin role for individual campaign checks

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Test Your Campaign with 1,001 Impressions
Since you mentioned your campaign has 1,001 impressions exceeding the 606 target:

```bash
# 1. Check current status
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/v1/campaigns/YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID/completion-status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# 2. Trigger completion check for that specific campaign
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/v1/campaigns/YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID/completion-check" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# 3. Verify it was completed
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/v1/campaigns/YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID/completion-status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Scenario 2: Global Check (Admin only)
```bash
# Trigger check for all campaigns
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/v1/campaigns/completion-check/trigger" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## üîç Expected Completion Criteria

The system checks these criteria for auto-completion:

1. **Impression Target:** `budget / paymentRate * 1000`
   - Your campaign: `budget/paymentRate*1000 = 606 impressions`
   - Current: `1001 impressions` ‚úÖ **EXCEEDS TARGET**

2. **Budget Threshold:** 80% of total budget used
3. **Time Limits:** Campaign end date reached

---

## üìä Completion Process

When a campaign is marked complete:

1. **Campaign Status:** Changed to `"completed"`
2. **G-Keys Released:** All locked G-keys for that category move to cooloff period
3. **Earnings Released:** Streamer earnings are made available for withdrawal
4. **Notifications:** Sent to brand and participating streamers

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **401 Unauthorized:** Check your JWT token
2. **403 Forbidden:** Admin role required for global trigger
3. **404 Not Found:** Verify campaign ID exists
4. **500 Server Error:** MongoDB connection issues

### Debug Logs:
When you trigger the endpoints, watch the server logs for:
```
[Nest] DEBUG [CampaignCompletionService] === ENTERING checkAllCampaignsForCompletion METHOD ===
[Nest] DEBUG [CampaignCompletionService] Found 3 active campaigns to check
[Nest] DEBUG [CampaignCompletionService] Campaign 64f8d3c9... meets completion criteria: Impression target exceeded
```

## üéâ Next Steps

1. **Start MongoDB** (or use mock module for testing)
2. **Get authentication token** for your user
3. **Find your campaign ID** from the database
4. **Test the endpoints** using the examples above
5. **Verify G-keys** are released to cooloff period

Your campaign with 1,001 impressions should be automatically completed once you trigger the check!
