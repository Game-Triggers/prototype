## Current Architecture

Currently, the Gametriggers platform uses:
- A unified Next.js application with an embedded NestJS backend
- MongoDB for all data storage
- NextAuth for authentication
- Role-based access (brand vs. streamer) within a unified User schema
- Monolithic API structure

## Target Architecture

The target architecture will:
- Maintain Next.js frontend but connect to distributed backend services
- Implement distinct microservices for key platform functions
- Separate brands and streamers into distinct entities with dedicated services
- Utilize specialized databases for different services as appropriate
- Implement a robust API gateway for service orchestration
- Support independent scaling of high-load components

## Entity Separation Strategy

### Current User Schema

Currently, users are differentiated by role:

```typescript
interface User {
  _id: string;
  email: string;
  username: string;
  password: string; // Hashed
  role: 'brand' | 'streamer' | 'admin';
  profile: {
    // Common fields
    name: string;
    // Brand-specific fields
    companyName?: string;
    industry?: string;
    // Streamer-specific fields
    platform?: 'twitch' | 'youtube' | 'other';
    channelUrl?: string;
    averageViewers?: number;
  };
  // Other fields...
}
```

### New Entity Model

We'll implement completely separate entities:

#### Brand Entity

```typescript
interface Brand {
  _id: string;
  email: string;
  password: string; // Hashed
  companyName: string;
  industry: string;
  contactPerson: {
    name: string;
    position: string;
    phone: string;
  };
  billingInfo: {
    address: string;
    taxId: string;
    paymentMethods: PaymentMethod[];
  };
  marketingPreferences: {
    targetDemographics: string[];
    contentCategories: string[];
    budgetRange: {
      min: number;
      max: number;
    };
  };
  campaigns: string[]; // References to campaigns
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### Streamer Entity

```typescript
interface Streamer {
  _id: string;
  email: string;
  password: string; // Hashed
  displayName: string;
  platforms: {
    name: 'twitch' | 'youtube' | 'tiktok' | 'other';
    username: string;
    channelUrl: string;
    metrics: {
      followers: number;
      averageViewers: number;
      peakViewers: number;
      contentCategory: string[];
    };
    verificationStatus: 'pending' | 'verified' | 'rejected';
    authTokens: {
      accessToken: string;
      refreshToken: string;
      expiresAt: Date;
    };
  }[];
  demographics: {
    primaryCountry: string;
    languages: string[];
    audienceAgeRanges: string[];
    audienceInterests: string[];
  };
  bankInfo: {
    accountHolder: string;
    accountDetails: string; // Encrypted
    preferredPaymentMethod: 'bank' | 'paypal' | 'stripe';
  };
  campaignParticipations: string[]; // References to participations
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Migration Approach

1. Create new schemas and services without disrupting existing functionality
2. Implement data migration utilities to convert existing users into appropriate entities
3. Gradually transition authentication and API endpoints
4. Implement dual-writing during transition period
5. Switch over completely once migration is verified

## Microservices Breakdown

We'll break down the monolithic backend into the following microservices:

### 1. Identity Service
- Manages authentication and authorization
- Handles user registration, login, and profile management
- Separate authentication flows for brands and streamers
- Integrates with OAuth providers (Twitch, YouTube)
- Generates and validates JWT tokens

### 2. Brand Service
- Manages brand profiles and company information
- Handles brand verification processes
- Tracks brand preferences and campaign history
- Manages billing information and payment methods

### 3. Streamer Service
- Manages streamer profiles and channel information
- Handles platform integration (Twitch, YouTube)
- Tracks audience metrics and performance stats
- Manages payout information and earnings tracking

### 4. Campaign Service
- Handles campaign creation, management, and lifecycle
- Processes targeting criteria and budget allocation
- Manages campaign assets and creative materials
- Tracks campaign performance and metrics

### 5. Participation Service
- Manages the relationship between streamers and campaigns
- Handles application process for campaign participation
- Tracks delivery of ads during streams
- Calculates earnings based on performance

### 6. Analytics Service
- Aggregates and processes performance data
- Generates reports for brands and streamers
- Provides real-time analytics during campaigns
- Handles data visualization for dashboards

### 7. Payment Service
- Processes payments from brands
- Manages automated payouts to streamers
- Handles invoicing and receipt generation
- Integrates with payment providers (Stripe, PayPal)

### 8. Notification Service
- Manages email notifications
- Handles in-app notifications
- Sends alerts for important events
- Manages communication preferences

### 9. Asset Service
- Manages upload and storage of campaign assets
- Handles image and video processing
- Delivers assets to streaming overlays
- Optimizes asset delivery for different platforms

## Data Management Strategy

### Database Separation

Each microservice will own its data, with appropriate databases selected based on service requirements:

| Service | Database Type | Justification |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Identity | MongoDB | Document structure for flexible profile data |
| Brand | MongoDB | Document structure for company profiles |
| Streamer | MongoDB | Document structure for streamer profiles |
| Campaign | MongoDB | Complex document structure for campaigns |
| Participation | MongoDB | Document structure with references |
| Analytics | TimescaleDB | Time-series data for performance metrics |
| Payment | PostgreSQL | ACID compliance for financial transactions |
| Notification | Redis + MongoDB | Fast queue + persistent storage |
| Asset | Object Storage + MongoDB | Blob storage + metadata |

### Data Consistency Approaches

1. **Eventual Consistency** for most cross-service operations
2. **Saga Pattern** for multi-step operations that span services
3. **Event Sourcing** for critical data changes that require audit trails
4. **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for high-read services

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow

1. Centralized authentication through Identity Service
2. JWT tokens with appropriate scopes for service access
3. Separate OAuth flows for streamers based on platform (Twitch, YouTube)
4. Token refresh mechanisms for long-lived sessions

### Authorization Strategy

1. Role-based access control at the API Gateway level
2. Fine-grained permissions managed by individual services
3. Service-to-service authentication using mutual TLS or API keys

## Service Communication

### Synchronous Communication

- REST APIs for simple request-response patterns
- gRPC for high-performance service-to-service communication
- API Gateway for client-facing requests

### Asynchronous Communication

- Event bus (RabbitMQ or Kafka) for event-driven architecture
- Message queues for background processing tasks
- Event-sourcing for critical operations requiring audit trails

## API Gateway

Implement a dedicated API Gateway to:
- Route requests to appropriate microservices
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Implement rate limiting and throttling
- Aggregate responses from multiple services
- Provide API documentation and developer portal
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for resilience

## Deployment Strategy

### Containerization

- Docker containers for all services
- Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
- Helm charts for deployment configuration

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Automated testing for each service
- Independent deployment pipelines per service
- Canary deployments for risk mitigation
- Blue/green deployment for zero-downtime updates

### Infrastructure as Code

- Terraform for cloud resource provisioning
- Kubernetes manifests for service configuration
- GitOps workflow for infrastructure management

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation (2-3 months)
- Design and implement new entity schemas
- Create core microservices (Identity, Brand, Streamer)
- Develop migration scripts for existing data
- Set up new infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines

### Phase 2: Dual Operation (1-2 months)
- Implement API Gateway with routing to both monolith and microservices
- Begin dual-writing data to both systems
- Gradually shift read operations to new services
- Test thoroughly with synthetic and production data

### Phase 3: Service Migration (3-4 months)
- Migrate remaining functionality to microservices
- Move campaign and participation management
- Implement analytics and payment services
- Shift all read and write operations to new architecture

### Phase 4: Completion (1 month)
- Decommission monolithic backend
- Complete optimization of new architecture
- Finalize monitoring and observability tooling
- Document new architecture and APIs

## Monitoring & Observability

### Monitoring Stack

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- ELK/EFK Stack for log aggregation
- Jaeger or Zipkin for distributed tracing

### Health Checks

- Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes
- Service health endpoints
- Synthetic transaction monitoring
- Real-user monitoring for frontend

### Alerting

- Alert manager for notification routing
- On-call rotation for critical services
- Escalation policies based on service importance
- Automated remediation where possible

## Cost Considerations

### Infrastructure Costs
- Increased server resources for multiple services
- Database costs for specialized databases
- Network costs for inter-service communication
- Monitoring and observability infrastructure

### Development Costs
- Higher complexity in service development
- Additional DevOps expertise required
- Increased testing complexity
- Service contract management

### Operational Benefits
- Improved scalability for high-load components
- Better fault isolation and resilience
- More targeted resource allocation
- Flexibility in technology choices per service

## Conclusion

Transitioning from a monolithic architecture with role-based users to a microservices architecture with separate brand and streamer entities represents a significant evolution for the Gametriggers platform. While this transition requires substantial investment in time and resources, it provides a foundation for improved scalability, resilience, and feature development in the future.

This strategy should be implemented incrementally, with clear success metrics at each phase to ensure the migration proceeds smoothly without disrupting existing operations.
