## Current Architecture

Currently, the Gametriggers platform uses:
- A unified Next.js application with an embedded NestJS backend
- MongoDB for all data storage
- NextAuth for authentication
- Role-based access (brand vs. streamer) within a unified User schema
- Monolithic API structure
- **Advanced wallet and payment infrastructure** with multi-currency support
- **Comprehensive KYC verification system** for financial compliance
- **Campaign fairness and conflict rules engine** to prevent overlapping campaigns
- **Sophisticated analytics and reporting system** with real-time metrics
- **Admin financial management tools** for platform operations
- **Billing and dispute resolution system** for automated invoicing and conflict handling

## Target Architecture

The target architecture will:
- Maintain Next.js frontend but connect to distributed backend services
- Implement distinct microservices for key platform functions
- Separate brands and streamers into distinct entities with dedicated services
- Utilize specialized databases for different services as appropriate
- Implement a robust API gateway for service orchestration
- Support independent scaling of high-load components

## Entity Separation Strategy

### Current User Schema

Currently, users are differentiated by role, with additional financial and compliance entities:

```typescript
interface User {
  _id: string;
  email: string;
  username: string;
  password: string; // Hashed
  role: 'brand' | 'streamer' | 'admin';
  profile: {
    // Common fields
    name: string;
    // Brand-specific fields
    companyName?: string;
    industry?: string;
    // Streamer-specific fields
    platform?: 'twitch' | 'youtube' | 'other';
    channelUrl?: string;
    averageViewers?: number;
  };
  // Wallet integration
  walletId?: string;
  // KYC status
  kycStatus?: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
}

interface Wallet {
  _id: string;
  userId: string;
  balances: {
    USD: number;
    EUR: number;
    GBP: number;
    // ... other currencies
  };
  transactions: Transaction[];
  paymentMethods: PaymentMethod[];
  pendingWithdrawals: Withdrawal[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface KYC {
  _id: string;
  userId: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
  documentType: 'passport' | 'drivers_license' | 'national_id';
  documents: KYCDocument[];
  verificationAttempts: number;
  // ... additional KYC fields
}

interface ConflictRule {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  ruleType: 'time_overlap' | 'category_conflict' | 'platform_exclusivity';
  conditions: ConflictCondition[];
  // ... rule configuration
}
```

### New Entity Model

We'll implement completely separate entities:

#### Brand Entity

```typescript
interface Brand {
  _id: string;
  email: string;
  password: string; // Hashed
  companyName: string;
  industry: string;
  contactPerson: {
    name: string;
    position: string;
    phone: string;
  };
  billingInfo: {
    address: string;
    taxId: string;
    paymentMethods: PaymentMethod[];
  };
  marketingPreferences: {
    targetDemographics: string[];
    contentCategories: string[];
    budgetRange: {
      min: number;
      max: number;
    };
  };
  campaigns: string[]; // References to campaigns
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### Streamer Entity

```typescript
interface Streamer {
  _id: string;
  email: string;
  password: string; // Hashed
  displayName: string;
  platforms: {
    name: 'twitch' | 'youtube' | 'tiktok' | 'other';
    username: string;
    channelUrl: string;
    metrics: {
      followers: number;
      averageViewers: number;
      peakViewers: number;
      contentCategory: string[];
    };
    verificationStatus: 'pending' | 'verified' | 'rejected';
    authTokens: {
      accessToken: string;
      refreshToken: string;
      expiresAt: Date;
    };
  }[];
  demographics: {
    primaryCountry: string;
    languages: string[];
    audienceAgeRanges: string[];
    audienceInterests: string[];
  };
  bankInfo: {
    accountHolder: string;
    accountDetails: string; // Encrypted
    preferredPaymentMethod: 'bank' | 'paypal' | 'stripe';
  };
  campaignParticipations: string[]; // References to participations
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Migration Approach
