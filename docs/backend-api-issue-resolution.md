# Backend API Issue Resolution

## Problem
The proxy route at `/api/user/me/campaign-selection` was returning 200 OK but the database wasn't being updated. Investigation revealed several issues:

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Missing GET Endpoint
The backend only had a PUT endpoint but not a GET endpoint for `/users/me/campaign-selection`. The proxy route was trying to call the GET endpoint which didn't exist.

### 2. Database Update Issue
The backend was using `user.save()` which could cause duplicate key errors (similar to the previous issue we fixed).

### 3. Authentication Issue
The backend API might not be receiving the correct authentication token or the user ID might not be correctly extracted.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added GET Endpoint
- Added `@Get('me/campaign-selection')` in `users.controller.ts`
- Added `getCampaignSelectionSettings()` method in `users.service.ts`

### 2. Fixed Database Update
- Changed from `user.save()` to atomic `findByIdAndUpdate()` operation
- Added proper error handling and debugging logs

### 3. Added Debugging
- Added console.log statements to track the flow
- Added logging for user data before and after updates

## Testing Results

### Manual Database Update
Manual update via MongoDB MCP works correctly:
```javascript
// This works and updates the database
await mongoCollection.updateMany(
  {"email": "kyadav.9643@gmail.com"},
  {
    "$set": {
      "campaignRotationSettings.preferredStrategy": "revenue-optimized",
      "campaignSelectionStrategy": "revenue-optimized"
    }
  }
);
```

### Backend API Issue
The issue appears to be that the backend API endpoint is not being called correctly or the authentication is failing.

## Next Steps

1. **Check Authentication**: Verify that the JWT token is being passed correctly from the proxy to the backend
2. **Check Backend Logs**: Look at the backend console logs to see if the endpoint is being called
3. **Test Direct Backend Call**: Test calling the backend API directly to isolate the issue
4. **Verify Environment**: Make sure the backend is using the correct database (`gametriggers`)

## Debug Commands

To check if the backend is receiving the request:
```bash
# Check backend logs for the debug output we added
```

To test the GET endpoint:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/users/me/campaign-selection \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

To test the PUT endpoint:
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/v1/users/me/campaign-selection \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"campaignSelectionStrategy":"revenue-optimized","campaignRotationSettings":{"preferredStrategy":"revenue-optimized","rotationIntervalMinutes":3,"priorityWeights":{"paymentRate":0.4,"performance":0.3,"fairness":0.3},"blackoutPeriods":[]}}'
```

## Status
- ✅ Manual database update works
- ✅ Backend endpoints added/fixed
- ✅ Atomic update operations implemented
- ❌ Backend API not updating database (investigation needed)
- ❌ Authentication/JWT token issue (likely)
