## 🎉 MISSION ACCOMPLISHED - COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION

We have successfully implemented **ALL critical monetary events** for both brand and streamer perspectives in the Instreamly Clone platform. The system now has complete monetary event coverage with proper code implementation.

POST /api/v1/campaigns/:id/activate         # Activate draft campaign
POST /api/v1/campaigns/:id/pause            # Pause active campaign
POST /api/v1/campaigns/:id/resume           # Resume paused campaign
DELETE /api/v1/campaigns/:id                # Delete with monetary cleanup
```

## ✅ STREAMER MONETARY EVENTS - COMPLETE

### 1. Participation Management Events
- ✅ **Campaign Joining** - No monetary impact (correct behavior)
- ✅ **Early Campaign Leaving** - `leaveCampaignEarly()` releases held earnings immediately
- ✅ **Participation Pause** - `pauseParticipation()` stops impression tracking
- ✅ **Participation Resume** - `resumeParticipation()` resumes impression tracking
- ✅ **Streamer Removal** - `removeStreamerFromCampaign()` with configurable earnings handling

### 2. Earnings Management Events
- ✅ **Impression Earnings** - `handleMilestoneCompletion()` credits with hold period
- ✅ **Earnings Hold Management** - Proper hold period tracking
- ✅ **Earnings Release** - On campaign completion or early leaving
- ✅ **Earnings Cancellation** - On campaign cancellation or violation removal

### 3. Enhanced Participation Tracking
- ✅ **Status Flow Management** - ACTIVE ↔ PAUSED ↔ LEFT_EARLY ↔ REMOVED
- ✅ **Impression Filtering** - Only counts impressions for ACTIVE participants
- ✅ **Audit Trail** - Tracks all participation state changes with timestamps

### 4. New API Endpoints
```
POST /api/v1/campaigns/:campaignId/leave                    # Streamer leaves early
POST /api/v1/campaigns/:campaignId/pause-participation      # Pause participation
POST /api/v1/campaigns/:campaignId/resume-participation     # Resume participation
DELETE /api/v1/campaigns/:campaignId/streamers/:streamerId  # Remove streamer
```

## 🛠️ ENHANCED SCHEMAS

### ParticipationStatus Enum (Updated)
```typescript
export enum ParticipationStatus {
  ACTIVE = 'active',
  PAUSED = 'paused',                      // Campaign-level pause
  REJECTED = 'rejected',
  COMPLETED = 'completed',
  LEFT_EARLY = 'left_early',              // NEW - Streamer left early
  REMOVED = 'removed',                    // NEW - Admin/brand removed
  PARTICIPATION_PAUSED = 'participation_paused'  // NEW - Streamer-initiated pause
}
```

### Campaign Participation Schema (Enhanced)
```typescript
// Added fields for participation tracking
leftAt: Date,
pausedAt: Date,
resumedAt: Date,
removedAt: Date,
removedBy: ObjectId,
removalReason: 'violation' | 'fraud' | 'admin_decision' | 'brand_decision',
earningsForfeited: boolean
```
