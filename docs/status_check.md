## Summary

The MVP is now complete with all requirements (FR001-FR009) fully implemented. The system architecture follows the planned structure with Next.js for the frontend and NestJS for the backend API.

Critical MVP functionalities - authentication, campaign management, overlay delivery, earnings estimation, and admin capabilities - are all fully functional. The admin interface allows administrators to:

1. View platform-wide statistics and metrics
2. Manage users (view, edit, enable/disable)
3. Moderate campaigns (approve, reject, pause, resume)
4. Access comprehensive financial reports

## Next Steps

1. Conduct thorough testing of all implemented features
2. Prepare for deployment of the MVP
3. Plan for post-MVP enhancements based on initial user feedback
