    userId: string,
    adjustmentAmount: number,
    reason: string,
    adminId: string
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Direct wallet balance adjustment with admin override
  }

  async freezeWallet(
    userId: string,
    reason: string,
    adminId: string
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Freeze wallet operations
  }

  async unfreezeWallet(
    userId: string,
    adminId: string
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Unfreeze wallet operations
  }

  async forceProcessWithdrawal(
    withdrawalId: string,
    adminId: string
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Force process a stuck withdrawal
  }
}
```

### 2. Create AdminCampaignService

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AdminCampaignService {
  
  async forceCampaignCompletion(
    campaignId: string,

    reason: string
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Force complete campaign regardless of normal rules
  }

  async overrideCampaignBudget(
    campaignId: string,
    newBudget: number,
    adminId: string,
    reason: string

    // Reverse a transaction with admin override
  }

  async investigateTransaction(
    transactionId: string,
    notes: string,
    adminId: string
  ): Promise<void> {

## Conclusion

While **brand and streamer monetary events are complete**, **admin monetary events are almost entirely missing**. Admins currently have very limited financial control over the platform:

### ‚úÖ Current Admin Capabilities
- Delete campaigns (with monetary cleanup)
- Remove streamers from campaigns
- Access all data with admin role

### ‚ùå Missing Critical Admin Capabilities
- Direct wallet balance management
- Transaction reversal and correction
- Campaign financial overrides
- Earnings administration
- Financial reporting and analytics
- Emergency system controls
- Comprehensive audit trail

**Immediate Action Required**: Implement Phase 1 admin events to provide essential platform financial control and oversight capabilities.

**Admin monetary events are critical for**:
- Customer service and dispute resolution
- Fraud prevention and response
- Platform financial health management
- Regulatory compliance and auditing
- Emergency response capabilities

The platform cannot be considered enterprise-ready until admins have comprehensive monetary control and oversight capabilities.
