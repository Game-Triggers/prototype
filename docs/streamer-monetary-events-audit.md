# Streamer Monetary Events Audit - Instreamly Clone

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive audit of all possible events and actions that should trigger monetary operations from the **streamer perspective** in the Instreamly Clone platform.

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Low Impact)
1. **Streamer Program Features**

   - Add referral system
   - Create exclusive campaign access

## Required Code Changes for Phase 1

### 1. Update CampaignsService for Participation Management

```typescript
// Add to CampaignsService
async leaveCampaignEarly(campaignId: string, streamerId: string): Promise<void> {
  // Release held earnings immediately
  await this.campaignEventsService.handleEarlyParticipationEnd(campaignId, streamerId);
  // Update participation status
  await this.participationModel.findOneAndUpdate(
    { campaignId, streamerId },
    { status: ParticipationStatus.LEFT_EARLY, leftAt: new Date() }
  );
}

async pauseParticipation(campaignId: string, streamerId: string): Promise<void> {
  await this.participationModel.findOneAndUpdate(
    { campaignId, streamerId },
    { status: ParticipationStatus.PAUSED, pausedAt: new Date() }
  );
}

async resumeParticipation(campaignId: string, streamerId: string): Promise<void> {
  await this.participationModel.findOneAndUpdate(
    { campaignId, streamerId },
    { status: ParticipationStatus.ACTIVE, resumedAt: new Date() }
  );
}
```

### 2. Add New Methods to CampaignEventsService

```typescript
// Add to CampaignEventsService
async handleEarlyParticipationEnd(campaignId: string, streamerId: string): Promise<void> {
  // Release held earnings immediately instead of waiting for campaign completion
  await this.walletService.releaseEarningsForCampaign(streamerId, campaignId);
}

async handleStreamerRemoval(
  campaignId: string, 
  streamerId: string, 
  reason: 'violation' | 'fraud' | 'admin_decision',
  forfeitEarnings: boolean = false
): Promise<void> {
  if (forfeitEarnings) {
    await this.walletService.cancelHeldEarnings(streamerId, campaignId);
  } else {
    await this.walletService.releaseEarningsForCampaign(streamerId, campaignId);
  }
}
```

### 3. Add New Controller Endpoints

```typescript
// Add to CampaignsController
@Post(':campaignId/leave')
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
@Roles(UserRole.STREAMER)
async leaveCampaign(@Param('campaignId') campaignId: string, @Req() req: RequestWithUser) {
  const streamerId = this.getUserId(req);
  return this.campaignsService.leaveCampaignEarly(campaignId, streamerId);
}

@Post(':campaignId/pause-participation')
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)  
@Roles(UserRole.STREAMER)
async pauseParticipation(@Param('campaignId') campaignId: string, @Req() req: RequestWithUser) {
  const streamerId = this.getUserId(req);
  return this.campaignsService.pauseParticipation(campaignId, streamerId);
}

@Post(':campaignId/resume-participation')
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
@Roles(UserRole.STREAMER) 
async resumeParticipation(@Param('campaignId') campaignId: string, @Req() req: RequestWithUser) {
  const streamerId = this.getUserId(req);
  return this.campaignsService.resumeParticipation(campaignId, streamerId);
}
```

### 4. Update ParticipationStatus Enum

```typescript
// Add to lib/schema-types.ts
export enum ParticipationStatus {
  ACTIVE = 'active',
  PAUSED = 'paused', // Existing
  REJECTED = 'rejected', // Existing
  COMPLETED = 'completed', // Existing
  LEFT_EARLY = 'left_early', // New
  REMOVED = 'removed', // New
  PARTICIPATION_PAUSED = 'participation_paused' // New - streamer-initiated pause
}
```

## Testing Requirements for Streamer Events

### 1. Participation Management Tests
```bash
# Test early campaign leaving
POST /api/v1/campaigns/:campaignId/leave
Authorization: Bearer <streamer-token>

# Test participation pause/resume  
POST /api/v1/campaigns/:campaignId/pause-participation
POST /api/v1/campaigns/:campaignId/resume-participation
Authorization: Bearer <streamer-token>
```

### 2. Wallet State Validation
- Verify held earnings are released when leaving early
- Check transaction history shows correct participation events
- Ensure withdrawable balance updates correctly

### 3. Edge Case Testing
- Multiple pause/resume cycles
- Leaving during hold period vs after release
- Admin removal vs streamer leaving

## Current Streamer Database State Analysis

Based on current database (gametriggers):
- **Streamer**: karma_sapiens has ‚Çπ0 balance (no campaign participation yet)
- **No active participations**: Streamer hasn't joined the existing campaign
- **Clean slate**: Perfect for testing streamer monetary flows

## Conclusion

While **brand-side monetary events are complete**, **streamer-side events need significant enhancement**:

### ‚úÖ Working Streamer Events
- Campaign joining (no monetary impact)
- Earnings credit from impressions  
- Earnings release on campaign completion
- Earnings cancellation on campaign cancellation

### ‚ùå Missing Critical Streamer Events
- Early campaign leaving with earnings release
- Participation pause/resume functionality
- Streamer removal handling
- Complete withdrawal flow
- Earnings dispute resolution

**Next Priority**: Implement Phase 1 critical missing events to provide streamers with proper control over their participation and earnings.
