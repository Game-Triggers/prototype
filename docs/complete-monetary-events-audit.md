### ❌ Missing/Incomplete Events

## 1. Campaign Status Change Events

### 🔴 CRITICAL MISSING: Campaign Activation (DRAFT → ACTIVE)
- **Current Issue**: No dedicated endpoint or method to activate a draft campaign
- **Required Action**: Reserve campaign budget from brand wallet
- **Impact**: HIGH - Campaigns can be activated without wallet reservation
- **Solution Needed**: Add endpoint and service method

### 🔴 CRITICAL MISSING: Campaign Pause (ACTIVE → PAUSED)
- **Current Issue**: No dedicated endpoint or method to pause campaigns
- **Required Action**: Stop charging for new impressions, keep funds reserved
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - No way to pause campaigns properly
- **Solution Needed**: Add endpoint and service method

### 🔴 CRITICAL MISSING: Campaign Resume (PAUSED → ACTIVE)
- **Current Issue**: No dedicated endpoint or method to resume campaigns
- **Required Action**: Resume charging for impressions
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - No way to resume paused campaigns
- **Solution Needed**: Add endpoint and service method

## 2. Budget Management Events

### 🔴 CRITICAL MISSING: Budget Increase
- **Current Issue**: Campaign update allows budget changes but doesn't handle wallet operations
- **Required Action**: Reserve additional funds when budget is increased
- **Impact**: HIGH - Budget increases don't reserve additional funds
- **Solution Needed**: Modify `CampaignsService.update()` to handle budget changes

### 🔴 CRITICAL MISSING: Budget Decrease
- **Current Issue**: Campaign update allows budget changes but doesn't handle wallet operations
- **Required Action**: Release excess reserved funds when budget is decreased
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Funds may remain unnecessarily reserved
- **Solution Needed**: Modify `CampaignsService.update()` to handle budget changes

## 3. Campaign Lifecycle Events

### 🔴 MISSING: Campaign Deletion
- **Current Issue**: `CampaignsService.remove()` doesn't handle monetary cleanup
- **Required Actions**: 
  - Refund all reserved funds
  - Cancel all held earnings
  - Process final payouts if needed
- **Impact**: HIGH - Deleting campaigns can leave funds in inconsistent state
- **Solution Needed**: Add monetary cleanup to remove method

### 🔴 MISSING: Automatic Campaign Completion
- **Current Issue**: No automatic completion when budget is exhausted or end date reached
- **Required Actions**:
  - Monitor campaigns for automatic completion conditions
  - Trigger completion flow automatically
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Campaigns may remain active after they should complete
- **Solution Needed**: Add scheduled job or event-driven completion

## 4. Participation Events

### 🔴 MISSING: Streamer Participation End
- **Current Issue**: No handling when streamer leaves campaign early
- **Required Actions**:
  - Release any held earnings for that streamer
  - Stop future charges for that streamer's impressions
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Incomplete participation handling
- **Solution Needed**: Add participation end handling

### 🔴 MISSING: Streamer Rejection/Removal
- **Current Issue**: No monetary handling when streamer is removed
- **Required Actions**:
  - Cancel held earnings
  - Refund charged amounts if applicable
- **Impact**: LOW - Rare event but should be handled
- **Solution Needed**: Add rejection/removal handling

## 5. Administrative Events

### 🔴 MISSING: Admin Campaign Cancellation
- **Current Issue**: Admin can delete campaigns but no monetary cleanup
- **Required Actions**: Same as regular cancellation but with admin privileges
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Admin actions should trigger proper monetary cleanup
- **Solution Needed**: Ensure admin actions use same monetary flow

### 🔴 MISSING: Admin Dispute Resolution
- **Current Issue**: No system for handling payment disputes
- **Required Actions**:
  - Hold disputed funds
  - Release or refund based on resolution
- **Impact**: LOW - Future requirement for dispute handling
- **Solution Needed**: Add dispute management system

## 6. Wallet Events (External)

### 🔴 MISSING: Auto Top-up Completion
- **Current Issue**: Auto top-up logic exists but completion handling unclear
- **Required Actions**: Update available balance after successful top-up
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Auto top-up may not work correctly
- **Solution Needed**: Complete auto top-up flow

### 🔴 MISSING: Withdrawal Processing
- **Current Issue**: Withdrawal logic may not be fully integrated
- **Required Actions**: Update balances after successful withdrawals
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Withdrawal flow needs validation
- **Solution Needed**: Validate and complete withdrawal flow

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Missing Events (High Impact)
1. **Campaign Budget Updates** - Modify `CampaignsService.update()`
2. **Campaign Status Changes** - Add activate/pause/resume endpoints
3. **Campaign Deletion Cleanup** - Modify `CampaignsService.remove()`

### Phase 2: Important Missing Events (Medium Impact)
1. **Automatic Campaign Completion** - Add monitoring service
2. **Participation Management** - Add participation end handling
3. **Auto Top-up Completion** - Complete auto top-up flow

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Low Impact)
1. **Dispute Management** - Add dispute resolution system
2. **Advanced Analytics** - Add monetary analytics tracking

## Required Code Changes

### 1. Update CampaignsService.update()
```typescript
// Need to add budget change handling
if (updateCampaignDto.budget !== undefined) {
  const budgetDifference = updateCampaignDto.budget - campaign.budget;
  if (budgetDifference > 0) {
    // Reserve additional funds
    await this.campaignEventsService.handleBudgetIncrease(id, budgetDifference);
  } else if (budgetDifference < 0) {
    // Release excess funds
    await this.campaignEventsService.handleBudgetDecrease(id, Math.abs(budgetDifference));
  }
}
```

### 2. Add New Campaign Status Endpoints
```typescript
// In CampaignsController
@Post(':id/activate')
async activateCampaign(@Param('id') id: string, @Req() req: RequestWithUser) {
  return this.campaignsService.activateCampaign(id, req.user.userId);
}

@Post(':id/pause')
async pauseCampaign(@Param('id') id: string, @Req() req: RequestWithUser) {
  return this.campaignsService.pauseCampaign(id, req.user.userId);
}

@Post(':id/resume')
async resumeCampaign(@Param('id') id: string, @Req() req: RequestWithUser) {
  return this.campaignsService.resumeCampaign(id, req.user.userId);
}
```

### 3. Update CampaignsService.remove()
```typescript
async remove(id: string, userId: string): Promise<ICampaign> {
  const campaign = await this.findOne(id);
  
  // Handle monetary cleanup before deletion
  if (campaign.status === CampaignStatus.ACTIVE || campaign.status === CampaignStatus.PAUSED) {
    await this.campaignEventsService.handleCampaignCancellation(id);
  }
  
  // Existing deletion logic...
}
```

### 4. Add New Methods to CampaignEventsService
```typescript
async handleBudgetIncrease(campaignId: string, increaseAmount: number): Promise<void>
async handleBudgetDecrease(campaignId: string, decreaseAmount: number): Promise<void>
async handleCampaignPause(campaignId: string): Promise<void>
async handleCampaignResume(campaignId: string): Promise<void>
```

## Testing Requirements

For each implemented monetary event, we need:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test service methods in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test full API endpoint flows
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
4. **Monetary Flow Tests**: Verify wallet and transaction state changes

## Monitoring and Alerting

Add monitoring for:

1. **Failed Monetary Operations**: Alert on any monetary operation failures
2. **Inconsistent Wallet States**: Regular validation of wallet balances vs. transaction history
3. **Stuck Campaigns**: Alert on campaigns that should auto-complete but haven't
4. **Budget Exhaustion**: Alert brands when campaigns approach budget limits

## Documentation Requirements

1. **API Documentation**: Update Swagger docs for all new endpoints
2. **Event Flow Diagrams**: Document monetary event flows visually
3. **Error Handling Guide**: Document how monetary errors are handled
4. **Admin Playbook**: Guide for admins to handle monetary issues

## Conclusion

While the core monetary events (campaign creation, milestone completion, campaign completion/cancellation) are implemented, several critical events are missing, particularly around campaign status changes and budget management. 

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Implement campaign budget update handling
2. Add campaign status change endpoints (activate/pause/resume)
3. Add monetary cleanup to campaign deletion
4. Write comprehensive tests for all monetary flows

The platform cannot be considered production-ready until all monetary events are properly handled in code, not just manually in the database.
